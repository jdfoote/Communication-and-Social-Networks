Welcome to Communication and Social Networks! 

In the class, we will think about and talk about and read about and write about how we are all embedded in networks with other people, and how those networks shape our lives. The class will be a mix of theory and practice, with readings and lectures on the theory of social networks, and labs and homeworks where you will learn how to use the R programming language to analyze social network data.
