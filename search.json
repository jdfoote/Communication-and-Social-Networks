You shouldn’t need anything especially new or powerful, but it needs to have room to install a few programs and enough memory to run them.\nThis semester, we are going to try using VSCode, an IDE which can write R code, and which includes a plugin to do AI-assisted coding. Our first R Lab will walk you through installing everything you need."

I do not expect you to read every word of these articles. Rather, you should practice intentional directed skimming. This article gives a nice overview. The TL;DR is that you should carefully read the abstract, introduction, and conclusion. For the rest of the article, focus on section headings and topic sentences to extract the main ideas."

As a result, there are three important things to keep in mind:\n\nAlthough details on this syllabus will change, I will not change readings or assignments less than one week before they are due. If I don’t fill in a “To Be Determined” one week before it’s due, it is dropped. If you plan to read more than one week ahead, contact me first.\nClosely monitor the class Discord. Because this is a wiki, you will be able to track every change by clicking the ‘history’ button on this page. I will also summarize these changes in an announcement on Discord that should be emailed to everybody in the class if you have notifications turned on.\nI will ask the class for voluntary anonymous feedback frequently. Please let me know what is working and what can be improved."

    "text": "Class Sessions\nThis course will follow a “flipped” classroom model. I expect you to learn most of the content of the course asynchronously. The goal of our time together is not to tell you new things, but to consolidate knowledge and to clear up misconceptions.\nThe Tuesday meeting will be a collaborative, discussion-centric session. Typically, about two-thirds of each session will be devoted to a discussion of the readings and videos from that week. The remaining third will be used to review the assignments.\nThis means that I expect you to come to Tuesday lectures having read the readings and watched the lecture videos. There are links to the readings and videos each week. You can also find lecture videos on Brightspace or on this YouTube playlist.\nThe Thursday meetings will be more like a lab. Some of these sessions will include synchronous activities; often they will be a time for me to introduce and help with R assignments. Sometimes they will be more of a co-working time, where you can work on assignments and I can be available to answer questions."

By asking and answering questions on Discord, you will not only help to build a repository of shared information but also reinforce our learning community.\nI will also hold office hours on Tuesdays, from 2-4. If you come with a programming question, I will expect that you have already tried to solve it yourself in multiple ways and that you have discussed it with a classmate. This policy lets me have time to help more students, but it’s also a useful strategy. Often just trying to explain your code can help you to recognize where you’ve gone wrong.\nI will also check Discord at least once a day. I encourage you to post questions there, and to use it as a space where we can help and instruct each other. In general, you should contact me there. I am also available by email. You can reach me at jdfoote@purdue.edu. I try hard to maintain a boundary between work and home and I typically respond only on weekdays during business hours.\n\nOnline Resources\nProgramming can be difficult and frustrating and confusing, but you will get it! I have put together a few resources to help you with the programming portion of the course.

I’d like you to:\n\nWrite down three concepts that you learned or connections that you made from this week’s reading and lecture.\nWrite down two questions you have or things that you don’t quite understand.\nShare one question that you think would make for a good discussion question.\n\nYou should submit your assignment on Brightspace.\nTake the discussion question (which can be based on the concepts you learned, or the things you don’t understand), and submit it (and up to one other question) that you think would be interesting to discuss on Monday by noon. Post your questions on the shared Google Doc at this link; try to group similar questions together.\nQuestions should engage with the readings and either connect to other concepts or to the “real world”. Here are some good example questions:\n\nThe readings this week talked a lot about how network ties get created. I made a list of my closest friends and I realized that most of them only became friends after we happened to be in the same groups over and over again. What role does repetition have in forming ties?\nI was confused by the reading on social capital. What’s the difference between social capital and power? And if they are the same, then why not just call it “network power”?\nImagine you were asked to analyze the network of a big company to help them to identify people who deserve a raise. What measures would you use to identify them? What would you not use?"

    "text": "This article analyzes data from the 1985 General Social Survey to provide a descriptive overview of the structure of core discussion networks in America. The networks examined are those alters that respondents named when asked to identify people \"with whom you discussed matters important to you\" over the last 6 months. The goal is to establish benchmark descriptions of major aspects of networks using a nationally representative sample.\nThe article examines measures of network size, density, and heterogeneity, as well as composition in terms of kin versus non-kin ties. Network size indicates social integration. Density, defined as the mean strength of ties between alters, measures network closure and potential for normative influence. Heterogeneity in characteristics like age and education reflect diversity of contacts.\nThe results show Americans' core networks are small (mean size around 3), kin-centered (55% kin on average), and dense (mean 0.61 on 0-1 scale). Nearly a quarter of respondents have marginal networks of 0-1 contacts. Networks are homogeneous compared to the population, especially racially/ethnically. Age and education diversity are 50-60% of sample diversity.\nThere is substantial variation across networks in size and heterogeneity. In 25% of networks, alter age diversity is less than 5 years; in 26% it exceeds 15 years. 30% of networks have education diversity less than 1 year; 27% exceed 2.5 years. Only 8% contain any race/ethnic diversity. Sex diversity is greater.\nDifferences are most pronounced by age and education. Network range is greatest for the young and middle-aged. Size drops with age, as does diversity. Education is positively associated with size, diversity, and non-kin composition. Blacks have smaller, less diverse networks than whites. Residents of larger places have lower density and more diversity.\nThe homogeneity relative to the population supports the characterization of these networks as \"core\" - they provide a small, dense, homogeneous environment centered on kinship. But the variability shows network range is constrained for older, less educated, rural respondents.\nThe data suggest the young, educated and urban have greater access to diverse contacts that may be beneficial for outcomes like information gathering. The standardized network measures allow examining links to outcomes like wellbeing.\nIn conclusion, the article provides a foundational descriptive analysis of core discussion networks using high-quality, nationally representative data. It establishes benchmark measures and documents subgroup differences relevant to research on social environments. The data will enable further network research."

    "title": "Claude.AI summary of Granovetter’s Strength of Weak Ties",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This 1973 paper by Mark Granovetter discusses the strength of weak ties in social networks. Granovetter argues that weak social ties, connections between individuals who do not interact frequently, play an important role in diffusion of information and opportunities. Weak ties act as bridges between densely knit cliques and groups, allowing ideas and information to spread beyond tightly knit social circles.\nGranovetter defines the strength of an interpersonal tie as a combination of time invested, emotional intensity, intimacy, and reciprocity. Strong ties are characterized by substantial time commitment, deep emotional attachment, and frequent reciprocal services. Weak ties require less time, intensity, intimacy and reciprocity.\nThe author hypothesizes that the stronger the tie between two individuals, the larger the proportion of mutual contacts they will share. This is because strong ties involve greater time commitment, leading to more overlap in social circles. Similarity also breeds connection – if A and B are both close to C, A and B are likely to become friends.\nGranovetter argues that weak ties play an essential bridging role in social networks. Information and ideas diffuse more rapidly across weak ties due to their bridging function. Weak ties provide shortcuts across social distance and allow ideas to permeate different social circles.\nThe paper explores the role of weak ties in job mobility, showing that many people find jobs through weak acquaintances rather than close friends. This illustrates how weak ties provide access to non-redundant information and opportunities.\nAt the community level, Granovetter suggests networks rich in local bridges (weak ties) lead to greater social cohesion and capacity for collective action. Fragmented communities composed solely of isolated cliques will struggle to organize effectively.\nThe author contrasts his model of weak ties to the Davis-Holland-Leinhardt model of transitivity in small groups. Granovetter claims transitivity depends on tie strength, being more likely when ties are strong, less likely when weak.\nOverall, the paper highlights the crucial bridging role played by weak social ties in diffusion, mobility, and community organization. Granovetter demonstrates the importance of linkage between micro and macro levels of sociological theory."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Robert Putnam argues that civic engagement and social connectedness in the United States has declined over the past few decades. He presents evidence of declining political participation, including decreasing voter turnout and public meeting attendance since the 1960s. Putnam also shows declining membership in organizations like churches, labor unions, parent-teacher associations, civic and fraternal organizations since the 1950s and 1960s. More people are bowling alone rather than in leagues. Neighborliness and social trust have declined as well based on survey data.\nPutnam considers some potential countertrends like the growth of national advocacy groups and support groups. However, he argues these tertiary groups do not necessarily foster the same kind of social capital, networks and norms of reciprocity, as traditional civic organizations. Analyzing General Social Survey data confirms the decline in associational memberships across educational levels since the 1960s and 1970s. International comparisons also show that despite still ranking relatively high in social capital, the U.S. has been experiencing notable erosion compared to other countries.\nIn examining why social capital is declining, Putnam considers factors like women entering the workforce, mobility, other demographic shifts, and the privatizing effect of television and electronic entertainment. He calls for further research to analyze the dimensions of social capital, effects of technology, social capital in the workplace, and costs/benefits of community engagement. Putnam also suggests exploring how public policy could aim to reverse these adverse trends.\nThe concept of social capital has relevance for democracies and democratizing societies. Putnam argues the decline of civic engagement in the U.S. may signify a democratic disarray that links to the erosion of social capital. He concludes by calling for ways to restore civic engagement and trust.\n\n\n\nStudy Question\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\nWhat evidence does Putnam provide for the decline of civic engagement in the U.S.?\nDecreasing voter turnout, reduced public meeting attendance, declining membership in groups like churches, unions, PTAs, etc. since the 1960s. Rise of solo bowling instead of league bowling.\n\n\nWhat are some potential countertrends Putnam considers?\nGrowth of advocacy groups like Sierra Club and support groups, though he argues these do not necessarily foster social capital like traditional civic groups.\n\n\nWhat factors does Putnam analyze as potentially causing the decline in social capital?\nWomen entering workforce, mobility, demographic shifts, technology privatizing leisure time.\n\n\nWhat is Putnam's main conclusion?\nThat the erosion of civic engagement and social connectedness in the U.S. since the 1960s signifies a democratic disarray and loss of social capital that needs to be addressed.\n\n\nWhat types of additional research does Putnam call for?\nAnalyzing dimensions of social capital, impact of technology, social capital in workplace, costs/benefits of community engagement.\n\n\nWhat is the relevance of social capital for democracy?\nSocial capital is seen as important for democracies and democratizing societies to function effectively."

    "title": "Bourdieu summary",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In his essay, Bourdieu argues that capital exists in three primary forms: economic capital, cultural capital, and social capital. Economic capital refers directly to money and assets that can be immediately converted into money. Cultural capital exists in three states: embodied, objectified, and institutionalized. The embodied state refers to the dispositions of the mind and body, which require time and effort to accumulate. The objectified state consists of material cultural goods like artworks, books, or instruments. The institutionalized state involves formal educational qualifications that credentialize cultural competence.\nSocial capital is comprised of the actual and potential resources accrued through relationships, social networks, and group membership. It depends on mutual recognition and obligation. Bourdieu contends that the different types of capital are convertible into one another, but conversions require varying degrees of effort and result in some loss of capital. Economic capital serves as the ultimate root of the other types of capital.\nStrategies of capital accumulation and reproduction are aimed at legitimating exclusive possession and transmitting advantage. Economic capital reproduces itself most directly. Cultural capital disguises its reproduction through indirect transmission in the education system. Social capital concentrates itself through delegation and representation. As direct transmission of capital is obstructed, indirect cultural reproduction through education becomes more important.\nCultural capital in its embodied state cannot be transmitted instantaneously. It declines with the passage of generations. Objectified cultural capital in the form of goods can be transmitted materially through inheritance or purchase. But it can only be symbolically appropriated by those possessing the necessary embodied capital. Institutionalized cultural capital in the form of educational credentials allows indirect conversion into economic capital.\nSocial capital depends on mutual recognition within social networks. It requires maintenance through continuous social exchanges and obligations. Social capital multiplies the value of the capital possessed by associated individuals. It is most easily accumulated by those whose relationships are automatically recognized as valuable. The convertibility of different capital types enables reproduction strategies but also incurs losses in the process. Concealed modes of transmission, like those for cultural and social capital, incur greater risks of loss.\n\n\n\nStudy Question\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the three fundamental forms of capital according to Bourdieu?\nEconomic capital, cultural capital, and social capital.\n\n\nHow does cultural capital exist?\nIn an embodied state, an objectified state, and an institutionalized state.\n\n\nWhat does social capital depend upon?\nNetworks of relationships and group membership.\n\n\nHow does capital reproduce itself?\nThrough legitimation strategies that vary for different forms of capital.\n\n\nWhy is cultural capital’s reproduction often disguised?\nBecause it happens through the education system rather than direct inheritance.\n\n\nWhat enables strategies of capital reproduction?\nThe convertibility between different forms of capital.\n\n\nWhy do capital conversions also incur losses?\nBecause transformations between capital forms require effort.\n\n\nWhen does indirect cultural reproduction become more important?\nWhen direct transmission of capital is prevented or hindered."

However, when we activate the edge table we don’t have information about the nodes. .N() lets us access the nodes table from the edge table, and from and to refer to the node that an edge is coming from and the node it is going to, respectively.\nSo, .N()$birthdate refers to the birthdate column in the nodes table, and .N()$birthdate[from] refers to the value of birthdate for the from node.\nPutting it all together, abs(.N()$birthdate[from] - .N()$birthdate[to]) subtracts the birthdate of the “to” node from that of the “from” node, and takes the absolute value.

One of my favorites is the viridis palette which is prettier and easier to read.\nIn order to change the color palette, you use scale_ functions.

You can try them out by changing the palette parameter. More info here.\nHere’s a quick example - try changing the palette to different numbers.\n\nG |&gt;\n  ggraph(layout = 'stress') + \n  geom_edge_fan(alpha = .2) + \n  geom_node_point(aes(color = as_factor(religion)), size = 3) + \n  scale_color_brewer(palette = 1)"

We will evaluate your work not based on whether your are ultimately successful, but how innovate your approach is, and how grounded it is in the network theories we have learned about.\n\nExamples\nBrooke Foucault-Welles has run a similar project in her class. Examples of well-designed projects in her class include:\n\nA comparison of the diffusion on Twitter of a plain-text and image-and-text message about feminism.\nAn alteration intervention that aimed to boost morale in a student organization by creating cross-cohort (year in school) friendship ties.\nA marketing campaign that leveraged the friendship paradox to spread the word about a new student group.\nAn intervention that targeted student leaders to lobby University Health and Counseling Services to bring therapy animals to campus during finals week.\n\n\n\nPresentation\nBecause this is a group project, I'll expect a lot more than the individual projects. Part of this is in being ambitious in the project that you select, but also in how you present your results.\nIn particular, those choosing this option will do a short (5 minute) presentation to the class at the end of the semester, to tell us about your project and your findings. It would be fun for those in the class to learn about what you've been doing.\n\n\nExecutive Report\nThe major part of the assignment, though, is a 5-6 page executive report. This report should have the following sections:\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the introduction you will describe the motivation for your intervention. You will explain what you did, and why you chose that approach.\n\nNetwork Theory\n\nIn your introduction, you will likely mention some network theories that helped to motivate your intervention. In this section, you will provide more detail about the theories that guide your work. You should include at least three references to support your approach and analyses.\n\nApproach\n\nIn the introduction you will give a high-level explanation of your intervention. Here you will provide a more detailed description, together with a more extended argument about why this is a good approach to meet your goals.\n\nAnalysis\n\nYou will analyze the effect of your intervention. The data to do this can take different forms - e.g., you may survey people to learn about awareness or beliefs, or you might gather data from the web or gather network data. At some point in your report you should include 1) a network analysis and 2) at least 1-2 network visualizations. It's possible that these may come earlier. For example, you might use existing data or simulated data to explain a network theory or to motivate your approach. If you are able to gather network data, then the network analysis and visualizations would probably be part of this Analysis section.\n\nConclusion\n\nFinally, write a few paragraphs reflecting on what was learned from your work.",

Group projects are expected to be more ambitious than individual projects.\nBasically, you will identify a network and a set of hypotheses/research questions that you would like to answer using data from that network. You will use network analysis and network visualization tools to answer those questions, and then you will report on and discuss your findings.\n\nFinding Networks\nThere are a number of repositories of network datasets. Probably the simplest to use are those found in the networkdata package, which we have already been using. If you look at the homepage of the package, you can see descriptions of the datasets that are included.\nAnother repository I really like is the Index of Complex Networks. You can filter by type of network, size, etc. One thing to note about these networks is that you will need to load them into R (unlike networkdata). They are in different formats, and you will likely need to do some work to get them to be igraph/tidygraph networks.\nFortunately, there are a number of tools in igraph designed to help you to import different file types. This page gives a great overview.\nEarly in the semester you should identify the network you want to work with and make sure that 1) it has the attributes you need to answer the questions you want to answer and 2) you are able to load it into tidygraph format.\n\n\nPresentation\nAs with the intervention assignment, I would like you to present a short (5 minute) presentation about your project toward the end of class.\n\n\nExecutive Report\nYou will prepare a ~5 page report, with the following sections:\n\nIntroduction\n\nGive a compelling introduction to the project: why is this something worth studying? You may also want to preview some of the results of your research.\n\nNetwork Theory\n\nIn your introduction, you will likely mention some network theories that helped to motivate your research. In this section, you will provide more detail about the theories, leading up to the development of 2-5 hypotheses or research questions. You should include at least three references to support your arguments.\n\nMethod and Data\n\nYou will explain how you are going to answer your research questions / hypotheses. Explain what data you will be using, and describe what analyses you will do, and why those are appropriate for answering your questions.\n\nAnalysis\n\nFor each hypothesis / research question, you will perform some sort of analysis. For some questions, this will be an analysis of network measures. For others, this might be a network visualization. Your analysis can include other types of analyses (e.g., statistical analyses) but it should include at least one network analysis and at least one visualization.\n\nDiscussion and Conclusion\n\nFinally, write a few paragraphs 1) summarizing the findings from your analyses and 2) reflecting on how your findings fit in (or don't) with network theories you learned about in the class.",

I expect that the final document will be ~5 pages long (maybe longer if you want to showcase a lot of visualizations).\n\nSample Business Data\nIf you would like, you can use data from a real organization. There are some great options of network data files already in igraph format at https://github.com/schochastics/networkdata.\nI created an example of how to load this data, and how to run some simple network metrics and visualizations. There's an RMarkdown file here and the HTML output here.\n\n\nExamples\nThis project is similar to a final project that Josh Barbour assigns to his class. You can find examples of their projects on Brightspace.",

    "text": "So far we have read about how social networks often have short average path lengths, and we are all much closer than we might assume. To an even greater extent than human networks, online networks display small world properties, in that there is high clustering but also short average path lengths. In this assignment, you will explore the network of links between Wikipedia pages.\nFor this assignment you will look for those short paths in the links between entries in Wikipedia. For example, imagine trying to get from the page of Purdue University to the page Brigham Young University (my alma mater) moving only through links on Wikipedia. That is pretty straight forward. One path is:\n Purdue University → NCAA → West Coast Conference → Brigham Young University\nThis path has 3 links. In general, there may be many paths, but always try to find the shortest. Finding a path between two universities is pretty easy. Sometimes things are harder and you make wrong turns. For example, if you tried to go from West Lafayette, Indiana to Abraham Lincoln you might go:\n West Lafayette, Indiana → Purdue University → West Lafayette, Indiana → Indiana → Illinois → Abraham Lincoln\nNote that you can go backwards in your search, as above. This path had 5 links.\nPlease describe the paths that you find for the following pairs (and keep track of wrong turns).\n\nPurdue University → Kevin Bacon\nKevin Bacon → Purdue University\nPurdue University → Henry VIII of England\nHenry VIII of England → Purdue University\nPurdue University → Moon\nMoon → Purdue University\nPurdue University → Reno, Nevada (my hometown)\nReno, Nevada → Purdue University\n\nGo to the website Six Degrees of Wikipedia and find the actual shortest paths.\nWork together with your partner to discuss and write brief answers for the following questions:\n\nWere you closer to the true shortest paths when you going from Purdue University or when you were going to Purdue University? Be specific and cite data.\nTravers and Milgram (1969) noted that of the 64 chains that reached the target 16 were sent by Mr. Jacobs, a clothing merchant in the town.\n\nDid you observe funneling in your searches to Purdue University? Why do you think this happened?\nDid you funnel in your searches from Purdue University? Why do you think this happened?\n\nImagine that you were going to advise a friend about how to get to the Purdue University page from a random Wikipedia page. What algorithm/strategy/approach would you advise them to use?\nThe diameter of a graph is the longest possible shortest path in a graph. For example, if you calculated the shortest path between all points on Wikipedia, the diameter would be the longest of these shortest paths. Try to find two pages that have a very long shortest path connecting them (remember you can find the degrees of separation here). However, there are a few rules: you can’t use the pages of asteroids; you can’t use any of the paths that are already listed on the web; and you can’t use brute force trial and error (i.e., just trying lots and lots of different random pages).\n\nWhat is the longest path you found?\nWhat was the process you went through to find this pair?"

You can probably ignore them.\nWINDOWS USERS: There’s a chance that this won’t work because VSCode doesn’t know where R is. This page has some instructions on how to fix it. Look under “Connect R”. If you can’t get it to work, ask a neighbor (or me) for help.\n\nInstall tinytex. Click the Quarto Preview terminal (in the bottom right) and type:\n\nquarto install tinytex\n\nClick the “Preview” icon at the top right, and hopefully it works!\nRead the document, make the changes that you are asked to, and then preview the document again. Notice that there is a new PDF file in the folder.\nUpload the PDF to Brightspace! You did it!!\n\nIf things aren’t working then ask a neighbor for help.\n\n\nVideo Walkthrough\nThis was from an older version of VSCode, but should still be helpful:\n\n\n\nSet up Github Copilot\nIf you want to use Github Copilot\n\nSign up for an account at Github education\nInstall the GitHub Copilot extension in VSCode\nAuthenticate using the popup that shows up in the bottom right\n\nWe will talk more about how to use Copilot in class.",

    "text": "This paper analyzes the role of peripheral online participants during protest movements. The authors examine Twitter communication networks during 3 different protests:\n\n2013 Gezi Park protests in Turkey\n2012 Occupy movement\n2012 Spanish Indignados movement\n\nThey also analyze 2 non-protest Twitter networks for comparison:\n\n2014 Academy Awards\n2014 Minimum wage debates in the US\n\nThe authors are interested in understanding the contribution of peripheral users - those who are less active or committed - compared to the core protest participants. They utilize k-core decomposition to identify core and peripheral users based on their position in the retweet networks.\nKey Findings:\n\nPeripheral users had similar audience reach (number of followers) as core users, but were less active in posting protest-related tweets individually.\nHowever, due to their large numbers, peripheral users contributed as much total activity (tweets) as core users and expanded the audience reach of protest messages.\nRemoval of outer k-cores in the protest networks decreased reach by ~50% but had less effect on total activity level. This suggests the periphery increased the core's audience.\nIn non-protest networks, the core and periphery contributed more equally to activity and reach.\nThe critical periphery seems especially important for amplification during protests compared to non-protest events.\n\nIn summary, the authors find that despite low individual activity, peripheral users as a collective contribute valuable resources for spreading protest messages and reaching a wider audience. This highlights the importance of the periphery in propelling protest visibility, even if they are less committed than core activists.\nTable of Key Questions and Answers:\n\n\n\nQuestion\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\nWhat was the purpose of this study?\nTo analyze the role and importance of peripheral online participants compared to core users during protest movements.\n\n\nHow were core and peripheral users defined?\nUsing k-core decomposition on retweet networks to identify core position versus peripheral shells.\n\n\nHow did core and peripheral users differ?\nPeripheral users had lower individual activity but much greater aggregate activity and reach due to larger numbers.\n\n\nWhat was the main finding?\nDespite having low individual impact, peripheral users as a collective contribute as much or more than core users for spreading protest messages and expanding audience reach.\n\n\nHow were protest and non-protest networks compared?\nThe critical periphery was more important for audience amplification in protest versus non-protest networks.\n\n\nWhat is the significance of the findings?\nThe large periphery of low-activity users plays a critical role in propelling protest visibility through their collective reach and activity."

We will be meeting in a computer lab, and I believe that we will be able to install everything you need on Purdue computers. If you would like, you may also want to install R and VSCode on your personal computer so that you can use it in the future when you no longer have access to Purdue resources. Our first R Lab walks you through how to do that."

I do not expect you to read every word of these articles. Rather, you should practice intentional directed skimming. This article gives a nice overview. The TL;DR is that you should carefully read the abstract, introduction, and conclusion. For the rest of the article, focus on section headings and topic sentences to extract the main ideas."

As a result, there are three important things to keep in mind:\n\nAlthough details on this syllabus will change, I will not change readings or assignments less than one week before they are due. If I don't fill in a \"To Be Determined\" one week before it's due, it is dropped. If you plan to read more than one week ahead, contact me first.\nClosely monitor the class Discord. Because this a wiki, you will be able to track every change by clicking the history button on this page. I will also summarize these changes in an announcement on Discord that should be emailed to everybody in the class if you have notifications turned on.\nI will ask the class for voluntary anonymous feedback frequently. Please let me know what is working and what can be improved."

    "text": "Class Sessions\nThis course will follow \"flipped\" classroom model. I expect you to learn most of the content of the course asynchronously. The goal of our time together is not to tell you new things, but to consolidate knowledge and to clear up misconceptions.\nThe Tuesday meeting will be a collaborative, discussion-centric session. Typically, about two-thirds of each session will be devoted to a discussion of the readings and videos from that week. The remaining third will be used to review the assignments.\nThis means that I expect you to come to Tuesday lectures having read the readings and watched the lecture videos. There are links to the readings and videos each week. You can also find lecture videos on Brightspace or on this YouTube playlist.\nThe Thursday meetings will be more like a lab. Some of these sessions will include synchronous activities; often they will be a time for me to introduce and help with R assignments. Sometimes they will be more of a co-working time, where you can work on assignments and I can be available to answer questions."

    "text": "Getting Help\nYour first place to look for help should be each other. By asking and answering questions on Discord, you will not only help to build a repository of shared information, but to reinforce our learning community.\nI will also hold office hours on Tuesdays, from 2-4. If you come with a programming question, I will expect that you have already tried to solve it yourself in multiple ways and that you have discussed it with a classmate. This policy lets me have time to help more students, but it's also a useful strategy. Often just trying to explain your code can help you to recognize where you've gone wrong.\nI will also check Discord at least once a day. I encourage you to post questions there, and to use it as a space where we can help and instruct each other. In general, you should contact me there. I am also available by email. You can reach me at jdfoote@purdue.edu. I try hard to maintain a boundary between work and home and I typically respond only on weekdays during business hours.\n\nOnline Resources\nProgramming can be difficult and frustrating and confusing, but you will get it! I have put together a few resources to help you with the programming portion of the course. Come back to these when you get stuck.\n\nFinding and fixing bugs in your code https://youtu.be/92Gicjnc_tk Video https://jeremydfoote.com/TDIS/week_8/debugging.Rmd R Markdown file https://jeremydfoote.com/TDIS/week_8/debugging.html HTML file\nIntro to ggraph and tidygraph https://youtu.be/geYZ83Aidq4 Video https://jeremydfoote.com/Communication-and-Social-Networks/resources/ggraph_walkthrough.Rmd R Markdown file https://jeremydfoote.com/Communication-and-Social-Networks/resources/ggraph_walkthrough.html HTML file"

    "text": "Reading Review Assignments\nIn a flipped class like this, it's really important that folks come prepared to discuss, work through misunderstandings, etc. In order to provide some accountability and space for reflection, each week you will have a review/reflection assignment about the readings and video.\nI'm calling this a \"3-2-1 Assignment\". I'd like you to:\n\nWrite down three concepts that you learned or connections that you made from this week's reading and lecture.\nWrite down two questions you have or things that you don't quite understand.\nShare one question that you think would make for a good discussion question.\n\nYou should submit your assignment on Brightspace.\nTake the discussion question (which can be based on the concepts you learned, or the things you don't understand), and submit it (and up to one other question) that you think would be interesting to discuss on Monday by noon. Post your questions on the shared Google Doc at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AK4MhWLVwDuxqvTwLomN7hu4aLpo59n5qXgEap8SBNc/edit?usp=sharing; try to group similar questions together.\nQuestions should engage with the readings and either connect to other concepts or to the \"real world\". Here are some good example questions:\n\nThe readings this week talked a lot about how network ties get created. I made a list of my closest friends and I realized that most of them only became friends after we happened to be in the same groups over and over again. What role does repetition have in forming ties?\nI was confused by the reading on social capital. What's the difference between social capital and power? And if they are the same, then why not just call it \"network power\"?\nImagine you were asked to analyze the network of a big company to help them to identify people who deserve a raise. What measures would you use to identify them? What would you not use?"

The only two kinds of family ties you should include and represent in your network are 1) the tie between a parent and a child and 2) the tie between two spouses or romantic partners. Be sure to include those parents and children who may no longer be living. Include only current spouses or romantic partners. Here are the steps to follow:\n\nGuess how many people will be contained in your network. Include your guess as part of your homework assignment.\nCreate an edge list of all nodes and ties through a method called snowball sampling: Start with yourself and name all the people who are your parent, child, spouse or partner. These are the nodes one step removed from you. Then list all the people who are the parent, child, spouse or partner of your parents, children, and spouse/partner. Some of these people will already have been listed in the prior step; the rest of them are nodes two steps removed from you. Be sure to give each person some kind of a name: it may be a first name only, a pseudonym, or descriptions like “Agatha’s Father” if you don’t know the person’s name.\nConvert this edge list into a matrix. Be sure to label each row and column.\nConvert this edge list into a sociogram (also called a network graph). Draw the sociogram in Google Drawings.\nHow many people are actually included?

People use it for lots of things, but in this class we will focus on using it to analyze and visualize social networks.\nTo help you to learn how to do this, we will go through a number of labs. The first ones will be really basic, but by the end you will be able to create complex, compelling visualizations from network data.\nIn the past, I have had students use R on their own computers. You are welcome to do that, if you would like. But I have also requested access for our class on the Scholar cluster run by Purdue research computing. Basically, there are a bunch of high-powered computers that our class has access to, and you can do your work there.\nIn this tutorial, you will learn how to log in to Scholar, and will get set up so you are ready for the labs.\n\nStep 1: Log in\n\nGo to https://gateway.scholar.rcac.purdue.edu/pun/sys/dashboard\nLog in with your BoilerKey\nClick on Interactive Apps: R Studio Server\nFor the options select \"scholar\", \"4.05\", 1 hour, 1 core (you can change this to up to 4 hours later when you're actually using it for work)\nClick Launch\nWhen the job starts, click \"Connect to R Studio Server\"\n\n\n\nStep 2: Install packages\n\nGo back to the console tab\nRun the following:\n\n   install.packages(\"dplyr\")\n   install.packages(\"ggraph\")\n\nNote: If you run into problems try the following:\n\nStop R (Session: Terminate R)\nClick on the Terminal tab (right next to \"Console\" in the bottom right of RStudio)\nCopy the following and right-click to paste it into the terminal:\n\n\n   rm -rf ~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.0/*\n\n\nStep 3: Load the Labs\n1. Download all of the labs by clicking this link.\n2. Go back into RStudio; in the bottom right pane click \"Files\", then \"New Folder\" and create a new folder for our class - something like \"COM 411 R Labs\".\n3. In that bottom right pane click \"Upload\", and upload the ZIP file. It should extract all of the labs for the class.\n\n\nStep 4: Testing\n\nIn the bottom right pane, click Files, then click on lab_1_r_markdown.Rmd. A weird looking file should show up in the top left pane.\nIn the top left pane, click \"Knit\". Some text should appear in the bottom left panel, and after 20 seconds or so, you should see a new window appear with a document titled \"Markdown and Network Plotting\".\nIt is fairly likely that you will get a bug when knitting about not having pandoc installed. If so, you will need to run the following in the Terminal tab:\n\n   module load anaconda\n\nThen restart R (Session : Restart R)\n\nWe'll talk about what all of this means soon, but for now, if that document appears, then you have done everything right and you're ready to go!"

    "text": "The paper reports on an experimental study by Jeffrey Travers and Stanley Milgram investigating the \"small world problem\" - the idea that society is highly interconnected with short paths linking any two people. The study tested this by tracing acquaintance chains from arbitrarily selected \"starting persons\" to a designated \"target person\" in Boston. The starters were from Nebraska and Boston. Each starter received a document to mail to the target. They could only send it to a first-name acquaintance who might advance it closer to the target.\n64 of the 296 chains reached the target, demonstrating the feasibility of the method. The mean chain length was 5.2 intermediaries, indicating a high level of social interconnectedness. Chains from the Boston starters were significantly shorter than Nebraska ones, showing the effect of geographic proximity.\nFunneling of chains through common intermediaries was observed - 3 people accounted for 48% of completions. Participants also showed strong tendencies to select demographically similar recipients based on age, sex and occupation.\nThe results provide insight into the structure of acquaintance networks and interconnectedness in a large population. The method appears useful for empirically studying social networks. Extensions could involve varying starter and target characteristics.\nOverall, the paper makes both a methodological contribution in demonstrating the viability of tracing acquaintance chains, and provides empirical evidence for the small world hypothesis that society is highly interconnected."

    "text": "Social capital refers to the resources and benefits that accrue to individuals and groups through their social networks. The concept has roots in sociological theories about social structure and community, with key early contributions by Bourdieu and Coleman. Social capital exists at both the individual and community level. At the individual level, social capital refers to the resources someone can access through their personal network ties. Measures like the position generator assess the range of occupational statuses an individual can reach. Research shows that those with more diverse networks and ties to higher status occupations tend to have better jobs and social mobility. However, social capital is unevenly distributed, with disadvantaged groups often having access to fewer valuable resources.\nAt the community level, social capital refers to features of social organization like norms of trust and reciprocity that facilitate collective action. Putnam popularized this notion in Bowling Alone, arguing that declining civic participation has reduced social capital in the U.S. Critics contend his argument involves tautologies. Nonetheless, subsequent research explores associations between community social capital and outcomes like health. For example, counties with more employed in voluntary organizations have lower recurrent heart attack rates, especially for low income residents.\nThere are debates about the extent to which social capital stems from intentional investment versus structural factors. Problematic analogies are sometimes drawn between social and financial capital. Unlike money, social ties do not function as a universal medium of exchange. Evidence for individuals consciously building networks for future payoffs is limited. Still, social capital remains a useful, if complex construct capturing the benefits embedded in social structure. Ongoing work seeks to refine concepts and measurements, like developing multidimensional approaches differentiating forms of social capital. A key frontier is elucidating cross-level interplay between individual networks and community characteristics. In sum, social capital highlights the value created by social networks, even if extracting that value involves navigating conceptual intricacies.\nStudy questions and answers:"

    "text": "Here is the summary with the table converted to wiki markup:\nThe paper examines how people of different socioeconomic status activate their social networks when faced with job loss threat. It defines network activation as the subset of a person's full potential network that comes to mind in a given situation.\nStudy 1 analyzed data from the General Social Survey, finding that when facing job threat, high status people activated larger, less constrained networks while low status people did the opposite. This supports the idea that threat causes people to defend their identities, with high status people asserting agency and low status people turning inward.\nStudy 2 was an experiment manipulating job threat. It replicated the finding that under threat, high status people activate larger, less redundant networks while low status people activate smaller, denser networks. This ruled out reverse causality as an explanation.\nThe studies support a cognitive perspective where networks are dynamic mental structures that shift cross-situationally. The activated network is key for subsequent mobilization of contacts for help. Activation and mobilization are distinct steps.\nPeople appear to activate networks that align with and support their perceived status. Threat amplifies these tendencies as people defend their identities. High status people expand networks to assert competence, low status people withdraw to core supporters.\nThe research complements structural explanations by showing within-person cognitive shifts in network activation. It also has methodological implications for studying networks, as \"errors\" in recall may reflect legitimate situational differences.\nFor low status people, inward network response to threat could reduce access to novel job information and worsen inequality. For organizations, broad socialization could help combat factionalism.\nLimitations include network contacts being passive, and activation as a one-time event rather than a recurrent process subject to learning over time. Future research could address these.\n\n\n\nStudy Question\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\nHow is network activation defined?\nThe subset of a person's full potential network that comes to mind in a given situation.\n\n\nWhat did Study 1 find about how different status people respond to job threat?\nHigh status activate larger, less constrained networks. Low status activate smaller, more constrained networks.\n\n\nHow did Study 2 complement Study 1?\nUsed an experiment to show the causal effect of threat on network activation differences.\n\n\nWhat is the proposed cognitive perspective?\nNetworks are dynamic mental structures that shift with situations as different aspects become accessible.\n\n\nHow does threat affect high vs low status people?\nHigh status people defend competence by expanding networks. Low status withdraw to core supporters.\n\n\nHow does the research complement structural explanations?\nShows within-person shifts not explained fully by stable network structure.\n\n\nWhat are some implications discussed?\nFor low status, inward response could reduce job information and worsen inequality. Factionalism risks for organizations.\n\n\nWhat are some limitations?\nContacts are passive, activation studied as one-time event rather than a process."
