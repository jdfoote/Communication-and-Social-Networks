# Troubled Lands Review

## Questions from Brightspace Assignment

> - How did you play differently in different versions?
> - What in real life is similar to each version of the game?
> - How did you decide whether or not to help others?
> - What does this have to do with social networks and social capital?!


## Debrief

> - What did you think about while playing?
> - How did you feel as you played? Did those feeling change across different versions of the game?
> - When do you help others in real life?

## Debrief

> - Were resources and abilities distributed fairly?
> - How should resources be distributed in the real world?
> - What role did communication play? How did your group make decisions?
> - Did you work to make things equal? Why or why not?
> - What kinds of inequality appeared in the game?

## Debrief

> - Did anyone sanction someone else? Why?

## Community Detection Review

> - What is a component? (Hint: there's often one "giant" component)
> - What is a clique?
> - What is the weakness of cliques as a way of identifying groups?
> - What is a k-plex? (Hint: related to cliques)
> - The goal of most community detection algorithms is high modularity. What does that mean?

## Core and Periphery Review

> - Why do groups often have a core and a periphery?
> - Given some of the other theories we've talked about, how would you expect the periphery to differ from the core?
> - What role does the periphery have in protests (BarberÃ¡ et al. reading)?
> - What is one way to identify who is in the core or periphery?

## Coreness Example

<div class='col fragment'>
```{r,message=F}
UK %>%
  activate(nodes) %>%
  mutate(coreness = node_coreness()) %>%
ggraph(layout='stress') +
  geom_edge_fan(alpha=.3) +
  geom_node_point(aes(color=coreness)) +
  scale_color_viridis_c(name='Coreness')

```
</div>
