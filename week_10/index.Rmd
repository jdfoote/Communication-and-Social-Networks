## Today's Dad Joke

Interviewer: "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"

Me: "Listening. I would say listening is my biggest weakness."


## Online COM 411

> - Flipgrid
>	- Things you learned + 1 thing you're still confused about
> - Assignments
> - Readings and resources


## Assignment

> - Example code is now on the wiki
> - Do your best, and build off of my code

## Diffusion and Contagion

> - What we do is influenced by what others do
> - Network effects
>	- Standards, languages, technologies
> - Beliefs

## Simple contagion

> - Small world networks make simple contagion (like COVID-19) is really hard to stop!
> - Most interventions are network interventions
>	- Stopping travel attempts to block "long" ties
>	- Social distancing and shelter-in-place attempt to reduce degree
> - The most important people to influence are those with high betweenness centrality

## Complex contagion

> - Most communication-related diffusions are complex
>	- You don't change beliefs/behavior just from influence from one other person
> - Complex contagions require multiple ties between groups
>	- This is one reason groups can persist in different beliefs

## Special People
> - Can we predict who will trigger large-scale information cascades?
> - Are there "influencers"?
> - Probably not
>	- If we look in hindsight, a viral tweet seems genius, appropriate, and well-timed
>	- There were likely hundreds or thousands of similar tweets
> - Luck + (ever-changing) structure of networks matter more than attributes of information or information spreaders

## Extra resources
> - Video about sources of homophily
> - Duncan Watts on common sense

## Thanks

> - Stay safe
> - Stay home
> - Look out for each other
