This paper analyzes the role of peripheral online participants during
protest movements. The authors examine Twitter communication networks
during 3 different protests:

1.  2013 Gezi Park protests in Turkey
2.  2012 Occupy movement
3.  2012 Spanish Indignados movement

They also analyze 2 non-protest Twitter networks for comparison:

1.  2014 Academy Awards
2.  2014 Minimum wage debates in the US

The authors are interested in understanding the contribution of
peripheral users - those who are less active or committed - compared to
the core protest participants. They utilize k-core decomposition to
identify core and peripheral users based on their position in the
retweet networks.

Key Findings:

-   Peripheral users had similar audience reach (number of followers) as
    core users, but were less active in posting protest-related tweets
    individually.
-   However, due to their large numbers, peripheral users contributed as
    much total activity (tweets) as core users and expanded the audience
    reach of protest messages.
-   Removal of outer k-cores in the protest networks decreased reach by
    \~50% but had less effect on total activity level. This suggests the
    periphery increased the core\'s audience.
-   In non-protest networks, the core and periphery contributed more
    equally to activity and reach.
-   The critical periphery seems especially important for amplification
    during protests compared to non-protest events.

In summary, the authors find that despite low individual activity,
peripheral users as a collective contribute valuable resources for
spreading protest messages and reaching a wider audience. This
highlights the importance of the periphery in propelling protest
visibility, even if they are less committed than core activists.

  What was the purpose of this study?                   To analyze the role and importance of peripheral online participants compared to core users during protest movements.
  How were core and peripheral users defined?           Using k-core decomposition on retweet networks to identify core position versus peripheral shells.
  How did core and peripheral users differ?             Peripheral users had lower individual activity but much greater aggregate activity and reach due to larger numbers.
  What was the main finding?                            Despite having low individual impact, peripheral users as a collective contribute as much or more than core users for spreading protest messages and expanding audience reach.
  How were protest and non-protest networks compared?   The critical periphery was more important for audience amplification in protest versus non-protest networks.
  What is the significance of the findings?             The large periphery of low-activity users plays a critical role in propelling protest visibility through their collective reach and activity.
