The paper reports on an experimental study by Jeffrey Travers and
Stanley Milgram investigating the \"small world problem\" - the idea
that society is highly interconnected with short paths linking any two
people. The study tested this by tracing acquaintance chains from
arbitrarily selected \"starting persons\" to a designated \"target
person\" in Boston. The starters were from Nebraska and Boston. Each
starter received a document to mail to the target. They could only send
it to a first-name acquaintance who might advance it closer to the
target.

64 of the 296 chains reached the target, demonstrating the feasibility
of the method. The mean chain length was 5.2 intermediaries, indicating
a high level of social interconnectedness. Chains from the Boston
starters were significantly shorter than Nebraska ones, showing the
effect of geographic proximity.

Funneling of chains through common intermediaries was observed - 3
people accounted for 48% of completions. Participants also showed strong
tendencies to select demographically similar recipients based on age,
sex and occupation.

The results provide insight into the structure of acquaintance networks
and interconnectedness in a large population. The method appears useful
for empirically studying social networks. Extensions could involve
varying starter and target characteristics.

Overall, the paper makes both a methodological contribution in
demonstrating the viability of tracing acquaintance chains, and provides
empirical evidence for the small world hypothesis that society is highly
interconnected.
