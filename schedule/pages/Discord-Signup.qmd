title: Discord Signup

We will be using [Discord](wikipedia:Discord_(software) "wikilink") for
most of the asynchronous communication needs in our class. If you are
confused about something please ask here first - chances are, others
have the same confusion.

Signing up for Discord is pretty straightforward. You will need to go to
<https://discord.com/> and create an account. I suggest downloading the
app but you can also use the browser-based version.

Once you have an account, open Discord and click the \"plus\" icon to
add a server, and the \"Join a Server\" and enter the following URL:
<https://discord.gg/WSc5J7stgg>

This should bring you to our server. There\'s one more thing you need to
do in order to get access to the class.


Click the Firework/Network icon (ðŸŽ†) and you should then see the COM 411
category on the left side.

I also made a video to walk you through how to do this if you get stuck.
