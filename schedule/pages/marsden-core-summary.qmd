This article analyzes data from the 1985 General Social Survey to
provide a descriptive overview of the structure of core discussion
networks in America. The networks examined are those alters that
respondents named when asked to identify people \"with whom you
discussed matters important to you\" over the last 6 months. The goal is
to establish benchmark descriptions of major aspects of networks using a
nationally representative sample.

The article examines measures of network size, density, and
heterogeneity, as well as composition in terms of kin versus non-kin
ties. Network size indicates social integration. Density, defined as the
mean strength of ties between alters, measures network closure and
potential for normative influence. Heterogeneity in characteristics like
age and education reflect diversity of contacts.

The results show Americans\' core networks are small (mean size around
3), kin-centered (55% kin on average), and dense (mean 0.61 on 0-1
scale). Nearly a quarter of respondents have marginal networks of 0-1
contacts. Networks are homogeneous compared to the population,
especially racially/ethnically. Age and education diversity are 50-60%
of sample diversity.

There is substantial variation across networks in size and
heterogeneity. In 25% of networks, alter age diversity is less than 5
years; in 26% it exceeds 15 years. 30% of networks have education
diversity less than 1 year; 27% exceed 2.5 years. Only 8% contain any
race/ethnic diversity. Sex diversity is greater.

Differences are most pronounced by age and education. Network range is
greatest for the young and middle-aged. Size drops with age, as does
diversity. Education is positively associated with size, diversity, and
non-kin composition. Blacks have smaller, less diverse networks than
whites. Residents of larger places have lower density and more
diversity.

The homogeneity relative to the population supports the characterization
of these networks as \"core\" - they provide a small, dense, homogeneous
environment centered on kinship. But the variability shows network range
is constrained for older, less educated, rural respondents.

The data suggest the young, educated and urban have greater access to
diverse contacts that may be beneficial for outcomes like information
gathering. The standardized network measures allow examining links to
outcomes like wellbeing.

In conclusion, the article provides a foundational descriptive analysis
of core discussion networks using high-quality, nationally
representative data. It establishes benchmark measures and documents
subgroup differences relevant to research on social environments. The
data will enable further network research.
