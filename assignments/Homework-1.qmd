**Before starting, read through [Individuals versus Networks](https://web.archive.org/web/20210617083354/http://www.umasocialmedia.com/socialnetworks/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/WhatIsASocialNetwork.pdf) by James Cook**. This will help you to finish the assignment.

1.  Define a set of people who you consider to be your \"family.\"
2.  Describe your family using an individual-level approach (e.g., \# of
    adults and children, locations, etc.). The easiest way to do this is
    probably as a table. E.g., the start of the table of my family might
    look like this. Be creative in the variables that you measure. :)
