Here's where you will find all of the assignments. Most of them are R Labs, which will include a Quarto (.qmd) file which you should download and open in VSCode. The first homework includes instructions on how to download and install Quarto and VSCode.

Most of the assignments have video walkthroughs to help explain them and get you set up.
