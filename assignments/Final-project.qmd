title: Final project
---
You can choose a final project from one of the following options:

1.  Network Intervention
2.  Network Analysis
3.  Company Pitch

More information about each option is below. For each project, you will
produce a research report of some kind. You should write this in a
Quarto file, and then export it to a Word document.

Please turn in two files:

-   Your .qmd file that includes your code
-   The Word document or PDF version of the report. Figure out to set
    echo=FALSE, so that it doesn\'t include all of your code, and just
    looks like a nice report.

## Network Intervention {#network_intervention}

In teams of 3 or 4, you will design, carry out, and measure a network
intervention, using principles from this class, like diffusion,
contagion, social capital, etc. You will identify a
message/product/idea/etc and try to spread it, either within or beyond
Purdue.

I would encourage you to identify a goal that is meaningful to your
group; projects should be creative, courageous, and challenging. We will
evaluate your work not based on whether your are ultimately successful,
but how innovate your approach is, and how grounded it is in the network
theories we have learned about.

### Examples

[Brooke Foucault-Welles](http://brooke-welles.squarespace.com/) has run
a similar project in her class. Examples of well-designed projects in
her class include:

-   A comparison of the diffusion on Twitter of a plain-text and
    image-and-text message about feminism.
-   An alteration intervention that aimed to boost morale in a student
    organization by creating cross-cohort (year in school) friendship
    ties.
-   A marketing campaign that leveraged the friendship paradox to spread
    the word about a new student group.
-   An intervention that targeted student leaders to lobby University
    Health and Counseling Services to bring therapy animals to campus
    during finals week.

### Presentation

Because this is a group project, I\'ll expect a lot more than the
individual projects. Part of this is in being ambitious in the project
that you select, but also in how you present your results.

In particular, those choosing this option will do a short (5 minute)
presentation to the class at the end of the semester, to tell us about
your project and your findings. It would be fun for those in the class
to learn about what you\'ve been doing.

### Executive Report {#executive_report}

The major part of the assignment, though, is a 5-6 page executive
report. This report should have the following sections:

-   Introduction
    -   In the introduction you will describe the motivation for your
        intervention. You will explain what you did, and why you chose
        that approach.
-   Network Theory
    -   In your introduction, you will likely mention some network
        theories that helped to motivate your intervention. In this
        section, you will provide more detail about the theories that
        guide your work. You should include at least three references to
        support your approach and analyses.
-   Approach
    -   In the introduction you will give a high-level explanation of
        your intervention. Here you will provide a more detailed
        description, together with a more extended argument about why
        this is a good approach to meet your goals.
-   Analysis
    -   You will analyze the effect of your intervention. The data to do
        this can take different forms - e.g., you may survey people to
        learn about awareness or beliefs, or you might gather data from
        the web or gather network data. At some point in your report you
        should include 1) a network analysis and 2) at least 1-2 network
        visualizations. It\'s possible that these may come earlier. For
        example, you might use existing data or simulated data to
        explain a network theory or to motivate your approach. If you
        are able to gather network data, then the network analysis and
        visualizations would probably be part of this Analysis section.
-   Conclusion
    -   Finally, write a few paragraphs reflecting on what was learned
        from your work.

## Network Analysis {#network_analysis}

Either alone or in groups of up to 4, you will design and carry out a
research project based on existing network data. Group projects are
expected to be more ambitious than individual projects.

Basically, you will identify a network and a set of hypotheses/research
questions that you would like to answer using data from that network.
You will use network analysis and network visualization tools to answer
those questions, and then you will report on and discuss your findings.

### Finding Networks {#finding_networks}

There are a number of repositories of network datasets. Probably the
simplest to use are those found in the
[networkdata](https://github.com/schochastics/networkdata) package,
which we have already been using. If you look at the [homepage of the
package](https://github.com/schochastics/networkdata), you can see
descriptions of the datasets that are included.

Another repository I really like is the [Index of Complex
Networks](https://icon.colorado.edu/#!/networks). You can filter by type
of network, size, etc. One thing to note about these networks is that
you will need to load them into R (unlike `networkdata`). They are in
different formats, and you will likely need to do some work to get them
to be `igraph/tidygraph` networks.

Fortunately, there are a number of tools in `igraph` designed to help
you to import different file types. [This
page](https://igraph.org/c/doc/igraph-Foreign.html) gives a great
overview.

**Early in the semester you should identify the network you want to work
with and make sure that 1) it has the attributes you need to answer the
questions you want to answer and 2) you are able to load it into
tidygraph format.**

### Presentation {#presentation_1}

As with the intervention assignment, I would like you to present a short
(5 minute) presentation about your project toward the end of class.

### Executive Report {#executive_report_1}

You will prepare a \~5 page report, with the following sections:

-   Introduction
    -   Give a compelling introduction to the project: why is this
        something worth studying? You may also want to preview some of
        the results of your research.
-   Network Theory
    -   In your introduction, you will likely mention some network
        theories that helped to motivate your research. In this section,
        you will provide more detail about the theories, leading up to
        the development of 2-5 hypotheses or research questions. You
        should include at least three references to support your
        arguments.
-   Method and Data
    -   You will explain how you are going to answer your research
        questions / hypotheses. Explain what data you will be using, and
        describe what analyses you will do, and why those are
        appropriate for answering your questions.
-   Analysis
    -   For each hypothesis / research question, you will perform some
        sort of analysis. For some questions, this will be an analysis
        of network measures. For others, this might be a network
        visualization. Your analysis can include other types of analyses
        (e.g., statistical analyses) but it should include at least one
        network analysis and at least one visualization.
-   Discussion and Conclusion
    -   Finally, write a few paragraphs 1) summarizing the findings from
        your analyses and 2) reflecting on how your findings fit in (or
        don\'t) with network theories you learned about in the class.

## Company Pitch {#company_pitch}

Based on your work in this class, you will craft a pitch to help an
organization make sense of their own social networks and craft a
portfolio of your work with data drawing on the previous labs and
readings to support your pitch.

1.  Select a potential employer, and research them to identify the
    pressing organizational issues facing them as a company.
2.  Write a document for a potential employer that
    1.  Introduces you and states your professional objectives. (1
        paragraph)
    2.  Makes the case for the most important problems facing this
        organization or industry based on your research. Be sure to cite
        any literature that you use. (1 paragraph)
    3.  Explains how a network approach and your expertise in particular
        can help address the sorts of problems facing their organization
        and industry
        -   Include at least three distinctive insights (e.g., my
            expertise in network analysis can help you identify opinion
            leaders in this organization).
        -   Include example visualizations of each insight from your own
            work (or create new visualizations).
        -   Include ideas from and references to the class readings to
            make your case.
    4.  Closes with a request for a meeting to learn more about their
        organization.
3.  Compile and submit your document on Brightspace

While I want everyone to write and turn in their own document, I
encourage you to help each other with the visualization portions and to
ask questions on the group Discord channel. I expect that the final
document will be \~5 pages long (maybe longer if you want to showcase a
lot of visualizations).

### Sample Business Data {#sample_business_data}

If you would like, you can use data from a real organization. There are
some great options of network data files already in igraph format at
<https://github.com/schochastics/networkdata>.

I created an example of how to load this data, and how to run some
simple network metrics and visualizations. There\'s an [RMarkdown file
here](https://github.com/jdfoote/Communication-and-Social-Networks/raw/spring-2021/resources/final_project_example_code.Rmd)
and the [HTML output
here](https://jeremydfoote.com/Communication-and-Social-Networks/resources/final_project_example_code.html).

### Examples {#examples_1}

This project is similar to a final project that Josh Barbour assigns to
his class. You can find examples of their projects on Brightspace.
