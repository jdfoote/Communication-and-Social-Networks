# Review of R/igraph concepts

## Graphs can be represented as spreadsheets

If you want to follow along with this part of the video, you will need to download the following two files, and open them in Excel:

[Edges Spreadsheet](https://github.com/jdfoote/Communication-and-Social-Networks/raw/master/resources/edges.csv)
[Nodes Spreadsheet](https://github.com/jdfoote/Communication-and-Social-Networks/raw/master/resources/node_atts.csv)

```{r}
# Next, we load the spreadsheets into R, from the web
edges = read.csv('https://github.com/jdfoote/Communication-and-Social-Networks/raw/master/resources/edges.csv')
node_atts = read.csv('https://github.com/jdfoote/Communication-and-Social-Networks/raw/master/resources/node_atts.csv'  )
# You could also do this by loading them from your computer, with something like the following:
# edges = read.csv('/home/jeremy/Desktop/edges.csv') # You'd need to change this path to where they are saved on your computer
# node_atts = read.csv('/home/jeremy/Desktop/node_atts.csv')  
G = graph_from_data_frame(edges, vertices=node_atts)
plot(G)

```

```{r}
# The igraph object stores the attributes in edge and vertex objects. You can access the nodes with V() and the edges with E()
V(G)[[]]
vertex.attributes(G)

E(G)[[]]
edge.attributes(G)
```

And we can create or change attributes on the nodes or edges that we're looking at

```{r}
# Edges and nodes can have special attributes which are used for plotting.
# For example, here we change the color based on the type of edge
E(G)[which(type == 'Friendship')]$color = 'lightgreen'
E(G)[which(type == 'Enemy')]$color = 'tomato'

# Change width based on weight
E(G)$width = E(G)$weight * 2

# We can do the same with the nodes
# Here I change the color based on the behavior.
# Behavior goes from 1 to 4, so we need 4 colors
colors = c('lightgreen', 'orange', 'lightblue', 'tomato')
# We select a color based on the behavior
# colors[V(G)$behavior] creates a new vector of colors, based on the number in
# behavior.
V(G)$color = colors[V(G)$behavior]


plot(G, edge.curved = .3)
```

There are different ways to select which edges or nodes we want to change.

```{r}
# This is what I've been teaching you, but it only works when there are no NAs

V(G)[V(G)$age < 21]

# This is a shorthand for the same thing

V(G)[age < 21]

# If there are NAs, then you will get an error
# Let's add a new node without any attributes and try again
g1 <- add_vertices(G, 1, name='H', color = 'pink')

plot(g1)

# When we run this line we get an error about an unknown vertex selected.
# igraph doesn't know what to do with the missing data - so it throws an error.
V(g1)[age < 21]

# The simplest solution is to use 'which' - this returns a list of nodes and removes nodes with missing data

V(g1)[which(age != 21)]

# Once you have the list, you can do something like change the size

V(g1)[which(age < 21)]$size <- 20

plot(g1)

# We ran into trouble again, because we only have size for some nodes - we need it for all of them. The easiest way to do this is to just set a size for every node, and then change it for some.

V(g1)$size <- 10
V(g1)[which(age < 21)]$size <- 20

plot(g1)
```

You can use the same syntax to identify edges or nodes that you want to remove.

```{r}
# For example, this removes vertices with aga > 21
temp_graph = delete_vertices(G, V(G)[which(age > 21)])

# And then removes enemy edges
temp_graph = delete_edges(G, E(G)[which(type == 'Enemy')])
  
plot(temp_graph)
```


# Groups and Communities in Networks

When we think about friend groups the concept seems intuitive and like it should be quite simple to identify different groups in a network. However, when it comes down to actually figuring out where to draw lines around groups, it isn't so easy. I'm going to go through a few different concepts for groups and how you might visualize them in R.

## Components

The simplest version of a group in a social network is all of the people who are connected to each other. This is called a component. Most real-world networks include almost everyone in a single, "giant component". This seems strange at first, but an example can help to show why it works this way. Let's say you had a network of 50 people with two large components of 25 people each. If any one of the 25 people in one component adds an edge to any one of the 25 people in the other component, then the components merge. In other words, there are so many possible edges that would combine the components that one of them is bound to occur unless there is something separating the groups.

The following visualizations show a random graph as it goes from 3% density to 15% density. It quickly becomes a single, large component.

This attribute of networks means that components are rarely very interesting as a way of grouping nodes.

```{r}
# Don't worry about understanding this code - it's basically just plotting 
# different densities of random graphs
for(p in c(.03, .05, .1, .15)){
  G = random.graph.game(50, p)
  plot(G)
}
```


## Cliques

The next simplest idea is a clique - this identifies groups of nodes where everyone is connected to everyone else in the group.

Let's create a small world network, since this should have some grouping like we want, and then find the largest clique

```{r}
# Make a random graph
G = watts.strogatz.game(2,5, 1,.3)

# Find the largest clique(s)
largest_cliques <- largest.cliques(G)

# Change the color of the first largest clique
V(G)$color = 'orange'
V(G)[largest_cliques[[1]]]$color = 'green'

plot(G)

```

This is not a super intuitive way of identifying groups and it misses some clear areas that we would probably consider groups.

The reading discusses a number of tweaks to this approach, such as n-cliques (where everyone in the group has to be connected within a distance of n) and k-plexes (where everyone in the group has to be connected to all but k other members). Neither of these have implementations in igraph so I won't visualize them.

## K-cores

One other approach is called k-cores. The idea is to identify "central" and "peripheral" parts of a network. Each node gets a "coreness" number, which is the largest k for which it exists in a subgraph where all nodes are connected with at least k edges. This sounds super confusing, but it makes a bit more sense when plotted. igraph actually has some great tools for doing this.

```{r}

graph_coreness = coreness(G)
colors = rainbow(max(graph_coreness))
plot(G, vertex.color = colors[graph_coreness])

```

## More complicated algorithms

There are a number of more complicated algorithms for finding communities in networks, often called "community structure" or "clustering". The very bottom of [this page](https://igraph.org/r/doc/communities.html) shows those which have been implemented in igraph.

Most of them are based on one of two ideas - the first is [modularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity_(networks)). These approaches attempt to find partitions of a network which maximize the number of edges within groups and minimize the number of edges between them.

The second approach is based on "random walks". The idea is that if you start at a random place in a network and move along a random edge, and keep doing this over and over, then walks should generally stay within groups and rarely go between them.

I'll show you how to visualize a couple of these in igraph.

First, a modularity approach (example taken from https://kateto.net/network-visualization)
```{r}
# Community detection (by optimizing modularity over partitions):
clp <- fastgreedy.community(G)

# Community detection returns an object of class "communities" 
# which igraph knows how to plot: 
plot(clp, G)
 
# We can also plot the communities without relying on their built-in plot:
V(G)$community <- clp$membership
colrs <- adjustcolor( c("gray50", "tomato", "gold", "yellowgreen"), alpha=.6)
plot(G, vertex.color=colrs[V(G)$community])
```

And a random walk approach:

```{r}
clp <- cluster_walktrap(G)

plot(clp, G)
```

In most networks, these approaches are generally similar.
