## Setup

You are on a yacht in the middle of the ocean that is quickly sinking. 

Your location is unclear because vital navigational and radio equipment have been damaged in the fire. Your best estimate is that you are many hundreds of miles from the nearest landfall.

You and your friends have managed to save 15 items, undamaged and intact after the fire. In addition, you have salvaged a four man rubber life craft and a box of matches. Rank the items correctly and you will survive until rescue comes. 

## The unrealistic part

You need to decide on a ranking as a group, but you can only communicate with a specific set of people, and you can only communicate one-on-one.

Start by making your own ranking of the items, and then discuss with your group how you want to rank them as a group.

I will choose one person randomly to be the group "leader", and their final decision is the one that counts.

## Moon landing activity

You are a member of a space crew scheduled to rendezvous with a mother ship on the lighted surface of the moon. However, due to mechanical difficulties, your own ship was forced to land at a spot 200 miles from the rendezvous point.

During re-entry and landing, much of the equipment aboard was damaged and, since survival depends on reaching the mother ship, the most critical items available must be chosen for the 200-mile trip.

15 items are listed as being intact and undamaged after landing. Your task is to rank them in terms of their importance for your crew, to allow them to reach the rendezvous point. The 'expert' answers were compiled by a team of scientists and engineers at NASA.
