This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
x <- c(43,643,765)

print(paste0("The mean of x is ", mean(x)))
```


For example, this will create a new vector and then draw a histogram of it:

```{r}

ages <- c(18,19,21,20,17,18,20,19,22,25,22,19,20,21)
hist(ages, breaks = 7)

```



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor.

This is how you would load the data from https://kateto.net/network-visualization.

First, you need to download the dataset from [here](http://www.kateto.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/sunbelt2019.zip).

Download this file and unzip it. Then, change what's within the quotation marks to point to the location where it's saved on your computer:

```{r, message=F}

nodes <- read.csv("Dataset1-Media-Example-NODES.csv", header=T, as.is=T)
links <- read.csv("Dataset1-Media-Example-EDGES.csv", header=T)
```

Now we can convert this into a network
```{r}
library('igraph')
net <- graph_from_data_frame(d=links, vertices=nodes, directed=T) 
```

and plot it.

```{r}
plot(net)
```

For this (very brief) assignment, use https://kateto.net/network-visualization as inspiration and make this plot look nicer.

```{r}

# Your new plotting code here
