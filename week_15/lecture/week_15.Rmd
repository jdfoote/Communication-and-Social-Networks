## Plan for today

> - Review Collaboration lecture
> - Networks and Racism lecture
> - Discussion
> - Discussion Questions

# Networks and Collaboration

## Review Questions

> - What is a collective good?
> - Why do collective goods often fail?
> - How can networks help people to collaborate and solve the collective goods problem?

<aside class='notes'>
Rumors and defection

Transactive memory

Shared mental models
</aside>

## Review Questions

> - Why might we expect that Wikipedia and open source software would fail?
> - What are some reasons that they work?

# Networks and Race

## Racism in America

> - Overt, animus-based racism is (probably) declining
<img class='fragment' src='https://content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/POLL/9r8-rc0zn0eloptdnsbl3a.png'/>

## But there is still lots of racism

> - Some is psychological
>	- Unconscious biases
>	- Homophily
> - Some is "structural" and a result of past racism
>	- Examples in the built environment?
>	- In education?
>	- In hiring?

## Networks and racism

> - How can networks produce or maintain racially biased outcomes?
> - How does this tie into ideas about social/cultural/economic capital?
> - How can we use what we know about networks to reduce racial inequality?


## Networks matter a lot

<img class='fragment' src='./images/mto.png' style='width:300px'/>

> - In the 90s, people were given vouchers to move to lower poverty areas
> - Chetty at al. found that children did better as adults the longer they lived in higher income areas
>	- Why? One (the best!) explanation is that people form different friendships

## Takeaways

> - Networks provide a hidden inertia to society, reproducing the world as it is
> - Differences in economic capital or cultural capital are more visible
> - Our achievements are partially a function of our undeserved social networks
> - Worth thinking about "network equality"
