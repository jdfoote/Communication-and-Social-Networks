> - He couldn't see that well!

## Introductions
> - Try breakout rooms
- Name
- Year
- Major
- Closest connection to a famous person

## What is Communication and Social Networks?

## Social networks are much more interesting!

>- How do groups make decisions?
>- How do fads and fashions and misinformation and diseases spread?
>- How do our connections influence our perceptions about and behavior in the world?

## Who you are connected to can be more important than who you are

## Goals
> 1. Understand the foundations of network theory and analysis
> 2. Critically read social network studies
> 3. Learn how social networks relate to your own interests
> 4. Gain a basic understanding of gathering and analyzing network data in R

# How we reach those goals

## About the class

> - Building a learning community
> - Discussions vs. lectures
> - Resolving confusion
> - Project-based

## Discord Meetings

> - Tuesdays are "required"
> - Thursdays are typically more of a co-working time (but sometimes synchronous)
> - Discussion questions due on Mondays (in Discord)
> - Random cold calling based on questions
>	- I will track whether you are prepared
> - Think, pair, share

## Grading
>- Normal grading has some negative unintended consequences

>- How can we build a learning community?

## Grading
>- I'm interested in teaching, not assessing
> - Goal is to build in assessments that encourage learning and accountability
>- Assignments will be turned in on Brightspace and/or discussed in class
>- I will provide feedback
>- 4 times during the semester you will turn in reflection pieces
>- If I disagree I will reach out

## Dangers of this approach to grading

## Assignments

>- Homework
>	- Social network concepts
>	- Programming practice
>- Reading
>	- Discussion Questions due Monday at noon
>- Participation (in-class and online)

## Readings
> - Academic papers
>	- Typically linked from wiki
>	- A few on Brightspace (I will make this clear)
> - Textbooks
>	- Networks, Crowds and Markets
>	- Introduction to social network methods

## Programming

>- You will understand what this means! :)

```{r, echo = T, message = F, fig.height = 3.5}
create_notable('zachary') %>%
  activate(nodes) %>%
  mutate(group = as.factor(group_infomap())) %>%
  ggraph(layout = 'kk') +
  geom_edge_fan(width=.2) + 
  geom_node_point(aes(color = group), size = 5)
```
</div>

## Exam
> - One exam
>	- Goal is to encourage self-accountability

## Final Project

> - "Pitch" to an organization about how what you have learned could be used to help their organization


# Resources

## Discord

> - Conversation
> - Class sessions
> - Help
>	- In general, ask publicly so others can answer / see the answer

## Wiki

> - Schedule
> - Links to readings

## Brightspace

> - Some readings
> - Submit some assignments

## Office Hours

> - On Discord
>	- 1-to-1 meetings on Friday 10-12
>	- Sign up on the wiki

## Please be vocal
>- I will solicit feedback as part of reflections
>- Let me know what is and isn't working

## Assignments

>- Read the syllabus
> - This Thursday will be a (fun!) synchronous activity


## Questions?


# Simulation Activity

## Rules
- Only communicate through written messages, to neighbors
- Give resources with '$give jdfoote A'
- You can continue playing after you have all resources, if you want

## How did it go?

>- What worked well?
>- What didn't?
>- Who was fastest? Why?
>- What was the longest path a resource traveled?

## Global network

## Debrief topics to cover
- Degree centrality
- Reciprocity
- Social capital
- Structural holes
- Reputation and deceit
- Position and power
- Multiplexity
- Number vs. type of ties (centrality measures)
- Global/local networks
- Tie maintenance
- Sponsorship
- Norms and social conventions

## Meta discussion
- How does this differ from real-world networks?

- What does this make you see differently?
