## Social networks are much more interesting!

>- How do groups make decisions?
>- How do fads and fashions and misinformation and diseases spread?
>- How do our connections influence our perceptions about and behavior in the world?

## Who you are connected to can be more important than who you are

## Goals
> 1. Understand the foundations of network theory and analysis
> 2. Critically read social network studies
> 3. Learn how social networks relate to your own interests
> 4. Gain a basic understanding of gathering and analyzing network data in R

# How we reach those goals

## About the class

> - Building a learning community
> - Discussions vs. lectures
> - Resolving confusion
> - Project-based

## Grading
>- Normal grading has some negative unintended consequences
<div class='container'>
<div class='col'>
<img class='fragment' src='./images/discussion.jpg' style='max-width:450px;'/>
</div>
</div>
>- How can we build a learning community?

## Grading
>- I'm interested in teaching, not assessing
> - Goal is to build structures that encourage learning and accountability
>- Assignments will be turned in on Brightspace and/or discussed in class
>- I will provide general feedback
>- 3 times during the semester you will turn in reflection pieces
>- If I disagree I will reach out

## Class Meetings

> - Most content is asynchronous
>	- Readings
>	- Video lectures
> - Tuesdays
>	- Time discussing + reviewing concepts and homework
>	- Random cold calling
> - Thursdays 
>	- Activities
>	- R Labs
>	- Co-working / Office Hours

## Class meetings

> - I will work hard to make our classes valuable
> - Do the same; be prepared, open, and engaged
> - Class discussions are a fundamental part of the class and I expect you to be at every class

## Assignments

>- Homework
>	- Social network concepts
>	- Programming practice
>- Reading
>   - 3-2-1 on Brightspace
>     - 3 things you learned / connections made
>     - 2 questions / things that are still confusing
      - 1 discussion question for class
>	- Discussion Questions due Monday at noon
>- Participation (in class and online)

## Readings
> - Academic papers
>	- Typically linked from wiki
>	- A few on Brightspace (I will make this clear)
> - Textbooks
>	- Networks, Crowds and Markets
>	- Introduction to social network methods

## Programming

>- You will understand what this means! :)

```

## Exam
> - One exam
>	- Goal is to encourage self-accountability

## Final Project

Options:

> - Group project: network-based intervention (e.g., spreading an idea on campus)
> - (Group?) research project: analysis of network data
> - "Pitch" to an organization about how what you have learned could be used to help their organization
