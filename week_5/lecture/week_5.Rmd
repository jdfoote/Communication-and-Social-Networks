## Sources of data

> - Survey data
> - Experimental data
> - Observational data

## Constructs make social science difficult

> - Physicists can measure the things they are interested in
> - We are usually interested in theoretical constructs
>	- Identity
>	- Intelligence
>	- Race
>	- Norms
> - We have to "operationalize" these constructs by finding data that represent them


## Survey data

> - Pros:
>	- Asks the questions you want to ask
>	- Good "construct validity"
> - Cons:
>	- Small sample
>	- Selection bias
>	- Self-reporting

## Experimental data

> - Pros:
>	- Answers causal questions
> - Cons:
>	- Small sample (often)
>	- Construct validity needs to be argued for
>	- Generalizability - labs aren't the real world

## Observational data

> - Pros:
>	- Often gathered in normal settings
>	- Can be huge amounts of data
>	- Longitudinal
> - Cons:
>	- Typically not built for research questions
>	- Have to build measures to represent constructs
>	- Data can be "messy" and missing in opaque ways


## Data storytelling

> - Understand the limits of what data can and can't tell you
> - Think about whether the data gathering process could be influencing results
