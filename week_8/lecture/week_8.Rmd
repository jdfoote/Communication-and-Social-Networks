## Review Questions

> - What is the "geodesic distance" or "diameter" of a network?
> - What is triadic closure?
> - Why would we expect networks with high triadic closure to have high geodesic distance?
> - What was the Travers and Milgram experiment?
> - How can we have such high triadic closure but still have short path lengths? What was the key insight from Watts and Strogatz?
