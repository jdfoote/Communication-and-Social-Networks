## Housekeeping
> - Tech policy
> - Designated reminder
> - Proposed structure for class
>	- Semi-"flipped" class

## Questions from the homework
>- Edgelists
>- Matrices
>- Graphs

# Why is the network perspective so important?

## Power failure example

## Complex systems are all around us

> - Interdependent
> - Non-linear
> - Unpredictable, even when individuals are understood

## Segregation Example

> - Link to this example is on the wiki
> - Go through this with a partner
> - Discuss in small groups
> - Discuss as a class

## Emergence
> - How does individual behavior aggregate?
> - When is this simple? When is it complicated? (TPS)
> - Fire example
> - Boids example

## Interdependence and Structure

> - If components are interdependent, then how they are connected matters
>	- Both for individuals and for the system
> - What are some examples of this? (TPS)


## Structure of networks

> - What do real social networks look like?
> - What is clustering?
> - What is a random graph?

## Random Graph

```{r}
G = erdos.renyi.game(100, .3)

V(G)$size = 8
l <- layout_with_graphopt(G)
plot(G, directed = T, layout = l, vertex.label='')

```

## Actual social network

- Faculty friendship network

```{r}

library(igraphdata)
data("UKfaculty")

l <- layout_with_graphopt(UKfaculty)
V(UKfaculty)$size = 8
V(UKfaculty)$label = ''
plot(UKfaculty, edge.arrow.size=.3, edge.curved=.1, layout = l)

```

## Assignments

> - Read Chapter 3 of Six Degrees


# Six Degrees of Wikipedia

## Concepts from reading

> - Structure and agency
> - Clustering
> - Path lengths
> - Distance

## Putting it together

> - What does "Six Degrees" refer to?
> - What is the puzzle?
> - What is the solution?

## Milgram Experiment

>- What was he trying to do?
>- Did you find the results surprising?
>- Do you think that technology has changed this today? In what ways
>- What do you think the distance is of the Purdue network?
