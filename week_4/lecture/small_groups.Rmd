## Much of our lives are lived in the context of small groups

> - Families
> - Class groups
> - Roommates
> - Friendship groups
> - Work groups
> - Volunteer organizations

## Lots of network theories relate to the structure of small groups

> - Triadic closure
> - Reciprocity
> - Homophily

## Research has also focused on what makes groups effective at meeting their goals

> - Which network do you think would be most effective?

## It depends on the task!

> - Centralization is beneficial for simple tasks
> - Decentralization is beneficial for complex tasks or when information is scattered
> - Rings are pretty bad no matter what :)

## Communication isn't usually determined from on high

> - Communication networks both represent and enable patterns of communication

## Why do edges exist in small groups?

> - Social capital
> - Social exchange
> - Collective action
> - Transactive memory
>	- Know _who knows what_
>	- Knowledge is passed through communication

## In general, "integrative" groups perform better at complex tasks

> - Low hierarchy
> - Small periphery

> - In these groups, people are:
>	- Coordinated
>	- Motivated

## Groups are embedded

> - Work group vs. school assignment, etc.
> - People are also embedded in different groups
> - Tricky but important to consider the influence of environment
