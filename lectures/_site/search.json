It says that we want our relationships to be in balance If A is friends with B and B is friends with C, but A and C are enemies, then balance theory says that this is unstable. Ties will dissolve or change valence.\nThis does depend on the type of relationship, though. What if black represents “hates”? If A hates B and B hates C, then maybe A will like C. Or if A is in love with B and B is in love with C, then A may hate C. These triangles are the source of lots of literature!"
