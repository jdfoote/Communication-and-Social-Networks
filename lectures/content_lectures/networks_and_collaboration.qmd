## However, these goods have misaligned incentives


> - Individual incentive is to do little or nothing
>	- Especially when your contribution will make little difference
> - These goods are typically underproduced, without help


## Collaboration is the great human super power. How do we do it?

> - States or organizations that force people to make the "right" decision
> - Punishment for defection
> - Selective incentives
> - Heterogenous benefits


## What do networks have to do with collaboration?

> - People are "embedded" in networks
>	- Defecting has social impacts if they occur in networks
>	- Rumor is a way of promoting cooperation
> - Through networks, people can coordinate
>	- Figure out who knows what (transactive memory)
>	- Building shared understanding of goals (shared mental model)

## Online Collaboration works surprisingly well

> - Wikipedia and open source software often work better than what companies produce
> - Why does it work?
>	- Artifact does a lot of the work of coordinating
>	- Costs of contribution are lower
>	- Internet allows for the identification of people for whom contribution is easy
