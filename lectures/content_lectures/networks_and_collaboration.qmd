## Test

<div class="r-stack">
  <img class="fragment" src="https://placekitten.com/450/300" width="450" height="300">
  <img class="fragment" src="https://placekitten.com/300/450" width="300" height="450">
  <img class="fragment" src="https://placekitten.com/400/400" width="400" height="400">
</div>

## We are surrounded by "collective goods"

<ul>
<li class='fragment' data-fragment-index="1">
The whole group shares in the output, independent of their contributions
</li>
</ul>

<div class='container'>

<div class='col'>
<ul>
<li class='fragment' data-fragment-index="2">
Parks
</li>
<li class='fragment' data-fragment-index="3">
Roads
</li>
<li class='fragment' data-fragment-index="4">
National defense
</li>
<li class='fragment' data-fragment-index="5">
Lighthouses
</li>
<li class='fragment' data-fragment-index="6">
Group projects
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="col r-stack">
  <img class="fragment" src="images/park.jpg" width="450" height="200" data-fragment-index="2">
  <img class="fragment" src="images/road.jpg" width="450" height="300" data-fragment-index="3">
  <img class="fragment" src="images/park.jpg" width="450" height="300" data-fragment-index="4">

## However, these goods have misaligned incentives


> - Individual incentive is to do little or nothing
>	- Especially when your contribution will make little difference
> - These goods are typically underproduced, without help


## Collaboration is the great human super power. How do we do it?

> - States or organizations that force people to make the "right" decision
> - Punishment for defection
> - Selective incentives
> - Heterogenous benefits


## What do networks have to do with collaboration?

> - People are "embedded" in networks
>	- Defecting has social impacts if they occur in networks
>	- Rumor is a way of promoting cooperation
> - Through networks, people can coordinate
>	- Figure out who knows what (transactive memory)
>	- Building shared understanding of goals (shared mental model)

## Online Collaboration works surprisingly well

> - Wikipedia and open source software often work better than what companies produce
> - Why does it work?
>	- Artifact does a lot of the work of coordinating
>	- Costs of contribution are lower
>	- Internet allows for the identification of people for whom contribution is easy
