## How has technology changed networks?

> - A lot!
> - "Civilization" technologies allowed for larger groups
> - Books create cross-temporal knowledge networks

## The impacts of internet technology

> - Early adopters were optimistic
>	- Tech could connect everyone
>	- We would understand/appreciate each other through interaction

## The dark side has become much more apparent

> - Bots
>	- Put people in "unearned" network positions
> - Echo chambers
> - Mis/disinformation

## But also some important benefits

> - Finding people with niche interests
> - Support groups for those who are different
>	- More autonomy over who is "in" your network
> - Niche information
> - Opportunity to communicate/collaborate without networks

## Technology has huge implications for network research 

> - Social media has made large-scale human networks visible
>	- Degree distributions
>	- Network paths (six degrees of separation)
>	- Communication patterns
>	- Information and belief diffusion

## Social science is being reshaped by online data

> - We can look at thousands or millions of people
> - Starting to answer questions like:
>	- When do people change their minds?
>	- Why do people choose to cooperate?
>	- What predicts participating in a new group?
> - We can finally see global networks instead of just small portions

## But, there are some important caveats

> - Technology doesn't only record interactions, it shapes them
>	- Is this true of people, or true of Facebook/Reddit/Twitter?
> - Human systems respond to observation and evolve
> - Much is unobserved
>	- These are often "thin slices"
>	- In what other ways are people communicating?
>	- What other technologies or circumstances shape their behavior?

## Those who understand networks have an advantage

> - Advertisers, activists, and politicians who understand network principles like homophily, clustering, and complex contagion will see their messages spread farther and faster.
