## Social networks are much more interesting!

<img class='fragment' src='./images/zacharay_karate.png' height='200px' />

- How do groups make decisions?
- How do fads and fashions and misinformation and diseases spread?
- How do our connections influence our perceptions about and behavior in the world?

## Who you are connected to can be more important than who you are

## Goals
 1. Understand the foundations of network theory and analysis
 2. Critically read social network studies
 3. Learn how social networks relate to your own interests
 4. Gain a basic understanding of gathering and analyzing network data in R

# How we reach those goals

## About the class

 - Building a learning community
 - Discussions vs. lectures
 - Resolving confusion
 - Project-based

## Grading
- Normal grading has some negative unintended consequences

- How can we build a learning community?

## Grading
- I'm interested in teaching, not assessing
 - Goal is to build structures that encourage learning and accountability
- Assignments will be turned in on Brightspace and/or discussed in class
- I will provide general feedback
- 3 times during the semester you will turn in reflection pieces
- If I disagree I will reach out

## Class Meetings

- Most content is asynchronous
  - Readings + Video lectures
- Tuesdays
  - Time discussing + reviewing concepts and homework
  - Random cold calling
- Thursdays 
  - Activities
  - R Labs
  - Co-working / Office Hours

## Class meetings

 - I will work hard to make our classes valuable
 - Do the same; be prepared, open, and engaged
 - Class discussions are a fundamental part of the class and I expect you to be at every class

## Assignments

- Homework
	- Social network concepts
	- Programming practice
- Reading
   - 3-2-1 on Brightspace
     - 3 things you learned / connections made
     - 2 questions / things that are still confusing
      - 1 discussion question for class
	- Discussion Questions due Monday at noon

## Readings
 - Academic papers
	- Typically linked from wiki
	- A few on Brightspace (I will make this clear)
 - Textbooks

```

## Exam
 - One exam
	- Goal is to encourage self-accountability

## Final Project

Options:

 - (Group?) research project: analysis of network data
 - "Pitch" to an organization about how what you have learned could be used to help their organization
