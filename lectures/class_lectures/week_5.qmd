# Ego Network Activity

## What do our ego networks look like?

> - From time to time, most people discuss important matters with other people. Looking back over the last 6 months, who are the people with whom you discussed matters important to you?

## Making Connections

- Make an edgelist for each connection, with tie strength of:
	- Total strangers: 0
	- Especially close: 1
	- In between: .5

## Write attributes of your connections to a node attribute file

 - Sex
 - Education (years of education)
 - Race
 - Age
 - Kin or non-kin (are they related to you?)


## Calculate your statistics

- Network size
- Kin network size
- Non-kin network size
- Density
- Age heterogeneity
- Education heterogeneity
- Race heterogeneity
- Sex heterogeneity (proportion in majority)


## Importing and visualizing in R
> - Remember `graph_from_data_frame()`
