Code for making simply physician network

```{r}
library(networkdata)


simple_phys <- physicians %>% as_tbl_graph() %>% 
  activate(edges) %>% 
  filter(relation=='friendship') %>%
  select(-relation) %>%
  activate(nodes) %>%
  filter(city == 1) %>%
  mutate(specialty = recode(specialty, 
                            "1" = "GP", 
                            "2" = "Internal Medicine",

                            "9" = "Unknown"
                            )) %>%
