Each week is outlined in the sidebar. Click on a week to see the schedule for that week. This includes lecture videos, readings, and assignments.

As a reminder, the class is set up as a flipped classroom. This means that you will watch lecture videos and complete readings before class. Class time will be spent on activities, discussions, and group work.
