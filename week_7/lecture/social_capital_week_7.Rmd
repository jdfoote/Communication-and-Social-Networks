# The Forms of Capital

## What is capital?

> - "Accumulated labor which [...] enables [agents] to appropriate social energy in the form of reified or living labor." - Bourdieu
> - Three types:
>	- Economic
>	- Cultural
>	- Social

## Economic Capital
> - Money
> - Factories
> - Businesses

## Cultural capital

> - Culture, cultivation, assimilation
> - Developing a way of seeing and acting in the world
> - Also education and technical skills
> - Mostly "embodied"

## Social Capital

> - "the aggregate of the actual or potential resources which are linked to possession of a durable network of more or less institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition"
> - Bourdieu describes this as membership in a group
>	- Families
>	- Schools
>	- Parties
>	- Etc.
> - Our social connections can help us to mobilize the capital (cultural and economic) of others


## What is capital for?

> - Some goods are "purchased" with different kinds of labor
>	- E.g., emotional support and friendship
> - For Bourdieu, the goal is to improve and ensure position in social space
> - Capital can be traded for other kinds of capital.
>	- Money + time for education
>	- Gifts -> social capital

## How can we identify when people have social capital?

> - Closure and embeddedness
>	- Strong, dense, networks
>	- Reciprocal, repeated exchanges that encourage cooperation
> - Structural holes
>	- Connecting two groups
>	- Power to control information, gain new information
> - When might one or the other be beneficial?


## Strength of weak ties

>  - One of the most cited social science papers ever (> 55K citations!)
> - Initial question:
>	- How do people find jobs?
> - Survey showed that people found jobs through acquaintances rather than friends

## Strength of weak ties

> - What are the "weak ties" that Granovetter refers to?
> - Why is information more likely to come through weak ties?
>	- Homogeneity, redundancy, and bridges
> - How does this relate to Six Degrees?
> - Overall summary
>	- Some types of social capital (cooperation, support, etc.) are best served through dense cliques
>	- Others (innovation, information search, etc.) require connecting distant groups (bridges and weak ties)

## Societal level social capital

> - Putnam (in reading for Thursday) argues for the idea of generalized social capital
> - Do people trust each other?
> - Societies with trust are more successful. Why?

## Homework

> - Keep reading about these topics (2 more readings)

# Troubled Lands

## Dad Joke

I decided to kill off a few characters in the book I'm writing.

It would definitely spice up my autobiography.

## Troubled Lands

## Troubled Lands

> - Video
> - Rules
>	- Talking is fine
>	- No talking/interacting with other groups
>	- Can see other people's cards
>	- Must do one thing each turn
>	- Eroded -> Fallow -> Planted

## Round 1 - Collaborative

> - Group with highest total score wins
> - When done, bring weather cards for me for reshuffling
> - Winner?

## Round 2 - Competitive

> - Person in group with highest score wins
> - When done, bring weather cards for me for reshuffling

## Round 3 - Independent

> - Person of each type with highest score wins


## Take a few minutes to think/write about:

> - How did you play differently in different versions?
> - What in real life is similar to each version of the game?
> - How did you decide whether or not to help others?
> - What does this have to do with social networks and social capital?!


## Debrief

> - What did you think about while playing?
> - How did you feel as you played? Did those feeling change across different versions of the game?
> - When do you help others in real life?

## Debrief

> - Were resources and abilities distributed fairly?
> - How should resources be distributed in the real world?
> - What role did communication play? How did your group make decisions?
> - Did you work to make things equal? Why or why not?
> - What kinds of inequality appeared in the game?

## Debrief

> - Did anyone sanction someone else? Why?
